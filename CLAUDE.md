# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide for animath

## Project Overview

**animath** is a modular, browser-based toolkit for mathematical animations and
generative art, built with TypeScript, React 18, Three.js, and Vite. It is
deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages at `https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/`.

Every animation ("app") is a self-contained module that plugs into the shared
**workspace chrome** (`src/chrome/`, specified by `docs/redesign/DESIGN-SPEC.md`):
a landing **gallery** opens into a per-app **workspace** where the plot(s) and
the control panels are draggable windows on a dotted stage, opened from a left
icon rail whose icons come from a closed 11-archetype vocabulary. Five **skins**
restyle everything via one `data-theme` attribute; below 740px the workspace
re-chromes into a phone UI (stacked view cards, bottom dock, bottom sheets).
Apps declare themselves in a single registry (`src/apps.ts`) and pass their
panels/views to one `<Workspace>` component, so the chrome stays uniform across
every view.

## Quick Reference

```bash
npm ci              # install dependencies (use ci, not install, for reproducibility)
npm run dev         # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173/animath/
npm run build       # TypeScript check + Vite production build → dist/
npm run preview     # preview production build locally
```

Node >= 20, npm >= 10 required. The only CI check is `npm run build` (which runs
`tsc && vite build`). There are no automated tests, linter, or formatter.

  adding a new app that conforms to the framework. **Read this before adding a module.**
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — a historical design/consolidation proposal. Useful for
  background, but it describes a *proposed* structure that differs from what was
  actually built; treat the layout below as the source of truth.

## Routing

The app uses a **hand-rolled hash router** in `src/index.tsx`. Every route is
`React.lazy`-imported (code-split) and rendered **bare** — each app owns its
chrome by rendering `<Workspace>`. The route table is keyed by hash; the
visible app catalog comes from `src/apps.ts` (+ `src/chrome/catalog.ts`).

| Hash Route            | Component        | Description                                |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `#/` (default)       | `Gallery`        | Landing gallery of all apps                 |
| `#/complex-particles`| `App → ComplexParticles` | 4D complex-function particle viewer |
| `#/plane-transform`  | `PlaneTransform` | f as a transformation of the plane (two view windows) |
| `#/fractals`         | `FractalsGPU`    | GPU Mandelbrot / Julia / Burning Ship / Tricorn |
| `#/fractals-cpu`     | `Fractals2D`     | Legacy CPU 2D fractals (unlisted)           |
| `#/correspondence`   | `Correspondence` | Mandelbrot ↔ Julia, two linked view windows |
| `#/topology-walk`    | `TopologyWalk`   | First-person walk on a closed surface (twisting corridor / flat torus / Klein); `#/mobius` and `#/wrap-world` redirect here |
| `#/trinary`          | `Trinary`        | Three-star system: Observatory + Lab as top-bar modes (`#/trinary-lab` opens the Lab) |
| `#/stable-marriage`  | `StableMarriage` | Gale–Shapley algorithm + heatmap lab        |
| `#/agentic-sorting`  | `AgenticSorting` | Concurrent agent-based sorting              |
| `#/stable-matching`  | `StableMatching` | Rebuilt Gale–Shapley lab (matrix · welfare surface · lattice via layouts) |
| `#/polygon-worlds`   | `PolygonWorlds`  | Walk every closed surface from one glued polygon |
| `#/embed/complex-particles` | `EmbedComplexParticles` | Chrome-less applet for iframe embedding, URL-configured (docs/EMBEDS.md); demo host: `/embed-demo.html` |
| `#/embed/plane-transform` | `EmbedPlaneTransform` | Chrome-less two-pane plane applet for iframe embedding (docs/EMBEDS.md) |

Unknown hashes fall back to the `Gallery`. **`src/apps.ts` is the single source
of truth** for the user-visible catalog (order, name, icon, blurb); the gallery
adds per-card metadata (category, preview kind) in `src/chrome/catalog.ts`.
When you add an app you update the `routes` map in `index.tsx`, the `apps`
array in `apps.ts`, **and** the `META` map in `chrome/catalog.ts`.

## The workspace framework

`src/chrome/` renders the global chrome (full spec: `docs/redesign/DESIGN-SPEC.md`;
control inventory mapping: `docs/redesign/PARAM-MAP.md`). An app integrates by
rendering **one component**:

```tsx
<Workspace
  appId="my-app"            // persistence namespace (localStorage ws:<appId>)
  title={name} subtitle={formula}
  sections={sections}       // SectionDef[] — the control panels
  views={views}             // ViewDef[] — the plot window(s)
  layouts={layouts}         // optional built-in layouts (+ auto Compact/Everything)
  defaultLayoutId="essentials"
  explainer={markdown}      // the "?" modal (EXPLAINER.md [+ '---' + README.md])
  modes={…} activeMode={…} onModeChange={…}  // optional top-bar mode pills
/>
```

- `SectionDef = { id, title, arch, node, estHeight? }` — `arch` is one of the
  **closed 11-archetype vocabulary** (`chrome/workspace/archetypes.ts`):
  Define `subject`/`domain` · Render `view`/`color`/`marks`/`motion` · Drive
  `drive`/`playback` · Analyze `lab`/`readout` · System `quality`. The rail
  sorts by tier; never invent new icons — propose vocabulary changes in
  `docs/redesign/IN-PROGRESS.md`.
- `ViewDef = { id, title, node, defaultRect }` — the node fills a draggable,
  resizable, collapsible window body (`position:absolute; inset:0`); collapsed
  views are hidden, **never unmounted**, so WebGL state survives (`Canvas3D`
  ignores zero-size resizes). A header button takes any view **full screen**
  (CSS-only restyle of the same node — the WebGL context survives; Esc or the
  button restores); on phone, cards also height-resize from a bottom grip.
- `LayoutDef.views[id].open: false` hides a view in that layout (how
  Stable Matching's matrix/welfare/lattice and Trinary's Lab instruments
  present as layouts).
- The top bar carries the brand-mark **Home** (gallery is the only hub), the
  `Layout:` menu, optional mode pills, the **?** explainer and the SkinPicker.
- Analyze-tier panels should use the shared readout primitives from
  `chrome/readouts.tsx` (Breakdown / MiniHisto / Sparkline / StatGrid / Kicker).
- Apps with window-level key handlers (first-person walkers) must early-return
  when `document.activeElement` is a form control, so typing in panels doesn't
  drive the scene.

### Control primitives (import from `components/ControlPanel`)

`Slider`, `Pills` (segmented buttons), `Select` (dropdown), `Checkbox`,
`RangeSlider`, `NumberInput` (+ a legacy `Section`). These are the standard
building blocks for panel bodies, styled by `ControlPanel.css` on the theme
tokens (`--cp-*` vars alias `--fg`/`--accent`/…). Use them instead of
hand-rolling inputs so every app looks consistent.

## Architecture Patterns

### Anatomy of an app

Each app lives in `src/animations/<Name>/` and typically contains:

- A main `.tsx` component (the whole animation + its controls).
- `EXPLAINER.md` — short "what am I looking at" text for the **?** popup (`?raw`);
  shipped by nearly every app.
- `README.md` — *optional* longer write-up for the **About** section
  (`import md from './README.md?raw'`). `ParticleViewerShell` viewers render it
  automatically; custom apps render it if they choose, and some (e.g. the Trinary
  System) ship none.
- Optional helper `.ts` modules — pull simulation/algorithm logic and data out of
  the component (e.g. `physics.ts` + `presets.ts`, or `corridorGeometry.ts`).
- Optional `shaders/` directory (GLSL kept as inline template strings).
- Optional `.css` for CSS/DOM apps.

Inside the component, an app: (1) holds its own state with `useState`/`useRef`
(+ `usePersistentState` for settings); (2) defines its `SectionDef[]` panels
(bodies built from the `ControlPanel` primitives) and `ViewDef[]` view
window(s); (3) renders `<Workspace appId title subtitle sections views layouts
explainer>`. The scene (Three.js via `Canvas3D`, or DOM/CSS) is the view node.

### Three.js / particle (4D) viewers

The complex viewers are powered by the **`src/lib/particles` engine** plus the
turnkey `ParticleViewerShell` component, which together provide the standard
**Function / Domain / Camera / Color / Render / Motion / 4D Rotation / System**
panels (the `QuarterTurnControls` live in the drive-tier 4D Rotation panel),
gesture handling, and the rAF loop out of the box. The flow is:
`useParticleState` (state) → `useViewControls` (orientation/projection
controls) → build geometry/axes in `Canvas3D`'s `onMount` (which **must return
the cleanup** that stops the loop and disposes the scene — `startAnimationLoop`
returns the stop function) → `useUniformSync` pushes React state into shader
uniforms → `startAnimationLoop` runs the rAF loop.
**ComplexParticles is the canonical consumer** — though no longer a *simple*
one (it orchestrates per-branch materials across four render modes); copy its
shell wiring when building a new particle viewer and skip the multi-sheet
material plumbing unless you need it.

### 2D / fractal viewers

FractalsGPU and Correspondence render shader quads through orthographic cameras
inside their view windows and navigate with `useViewportGestures` (drag-pan,
pinch/wheel-zoom, tap). Palettes come from `lib/colormaps.ts`. Correspondence's
two linked windows are the two-view reference.

### CSS/DOM apps

StableMarriage, StableMatching and AgenticSorting render plain DOM with
`lucide-react` icons and their own CSS inside view windows; their controls live
in workspace panels like everyone else's. StableMatching shows how in-app tabs
become **layouts** (`views[id].open`).

## Interaction conventions

Particle viewers split **looking** (gestures) from **navigating** (buttons):

- **1-finger / mouse drag** orbits the camera (never the 4D rotation).
- **2-finger drag** pans the look-at target; on desktop, **right-drag**,
  **held `Space`+drag** or `Shift`+drag pan (the phone keeps a Drag
  Orbit | Pan pill for one-finger choice).
- **2-finger pinch / wheel** zooms.
- **QuarterTurnControls** (the drive-tier **4D Rotation** panel, draggable
  beside the plot): tap a ↻/↺ button for a single **eighth turn**
  (45°); the small toggle under each button starts/stops a **continuous spin** in
  that plane and direction (multiple compose, e.g. xy + uv = an isoclinic double
  rotation). One **Spin speed** slider sets the rate. Includes reset + drop-axis.
  The rows are **context-sensitive**: in the nonlinear **Hopf/Torus**
  projections (where a 4D turn deforms the image), they switch to three ambient
  **Yaw / Pitch / Roll** controls that orbit the 3D camera rigidly instead of
  rotating the 4D pre-image; the six 4D planes return in the linear projections.

Fractal viewers: drag to pan, pinch/wheel to zoom, and **Trace mode** (the
drive-tier Trace panel) spawns an iteration orbit from a tapped point.

Workspace windows: drag by the **header** (canvas gestures stay inside the
window body); resize view windows from the bottom-right handle; any
pointer-down raises a window; collapse from the header chevron. Arrangements
are saved via the top-bar **Layout** menu and persist per app.

### Projection modes (Complex Particles)

A 4D point `(x, y, u, v)` maps to 3D via the **projection slider** with three
sticky, labeled stops — **Perspective** (divide by `3 + v`) ⇠ **Torus**
(stereographic from the +v pole, soft-floored; the old "Stereo" was this same
map and was retired) ⇢ **Sphere** (the Hopf view; `ProjectionMode.Hopf`
internally) — where fractional positions are live GPU morphs, the 4D axis
cross fades out toward the torus (the scaffold takes over), and the
Torus→Sphere leg is the fiber collapse. **Drop X / Y / U / V** (discard the
named axis) remains on the 4D Rotation panel.

## Code Conventions

- **TypeScript strict mode**; functional components with hooks only.
- **Path alias** `@/` → `src/` (in both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`).
  Note: many files still use relative `../../` imports — both work; match the file
  you're editing.
- **State** is local `useState`/`useRef` only (no global store/context; the
  workspace owns only window/layout state, persisted per app under `ws:<appId>`,
  and the skin under `chrome:skin`).
- **Persisted settings**: `usePersistentState(key, initial)` (`lib/usePersistentState.ts`)
  is a drop-in `useState` that mirrors to `localStorage` (namespaced
  `animath:<version>:<app>:<field>`), so a user's controls survive a reload. Pass
  `key = null` to opt out. The particle viewers persist through
  `useParticleState({ storageKey })`; `clearPersistedState(namespace)` powers the
  "Reset settings to defaults" action. Persist *settings*, not transient view
  state (camera orbit/pan) or derived values.
- **Shaders**: GLSL as inline template strings under per-app `shaders/`.
- **Markdown**: `README.md` (About) and `EXPLAINER.md` (?) imported via `?raw`.
- **Base-aware asset paths**: load public assets with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
  (the Vite `base` is `/animath/`) — see `lib/textures.ts`.
- **Spelling — American English throughout**: all user-facing text and comments
  (UI strings, `README.md`/`EXPLAINER.md`, code comments) use American spellings —
  **color** (not colour), **center** (not centre), **behavior**, **gray**,
  **favor**, **neighbor**, **analyze**, and **-ize/-ization** verb endings
  (organize, minimize, normalize, stabilize, visualize). This matches the language
  defaults already used in code (CSS `color:`, `justify-content: center`; JS
  `normalize()`), so code and prose stay uniform. When merging a branch that
  introduced British prose, normalize it back to American.

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

Much of the old debt has been paid down: the three near-identical complex viewers
were consolidated into the `lib/particles` engine + `ParticleViewerShell` (Roots
and Multibranch are now modes of ComplexParticles); complex math lives in
`lib/complexMath.ts`; texture factories in `lib/textures.ts`; code splitting is in
place via `React.lazy`; the HDR texture path is now `base`-aware; touch/gesture
support exists across the 3D, 2D, and DOM apps; and the former orphan `Fractals2D`
is reachable at `#/fractals-cpu`.

Remaining items:

1. **No linter / formatter / test runner** — no eslint, prettier, or `npm test`.
   The only validation is `npm run build`.
2. **Deploy workflow has a duplicate `configure-pages` step** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
3. **Orphaned utilities** — `lib/ParticleDisplay.ts`, `lib/R2Mapping.ts`, and
   `materials/index.ts` are never imported.
4. **Placeholder files** — `requirements.txt` and `run/setup.sh` are empty stubs.
5. **XSS surface** — `Readme.tsx` uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with `marked`
   output (content is first-party only, but unsanitised).
6. **`ARCHITECTURE.md` is aspirational** — it proposes a `core/widgets/ui` layout
   that was not adopted; the actual shared code lives in `components/` and `lib/`.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a new app

Follow **docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md**. In short:

1. Create `src/animations/MyApp/MyApp.tsx` (+ `README.md`, `EXPLAINER.md`).
2. Register the route in `src/index.tsx` (`React.lazy` import + `routes` entry).
3. Register the catalog entry in `src/apps.ts` (`hash`, `name`, `icon`, `blurb`)
   **and** its gallery metadata (category + preview kind) in `src/chrome/catalog.ts`.
4. Define `SectionDef[]` panels (archetypes from the closed vocabulary) and
   `ViewDef[]` view window(s), then render `<Workspace appId … />` with panel
   bodies built from the `ControlPanel` primitives. For 4D particle viewers,
   build on `ParticleViewerShell` + `lib/particles` (copy ComplexParticles).
5. Document *your* app: add its row to the **Routing** table above and a line to
   the repository-layout tree (and to `README.md`). Append — don't reorder.
6. `npm run build` must pass.

> **Parallel branches.** Several app branches are often in flight at once
> (frequently in separate agent threads). The framework keeps that conflict-free
> because each app is a self-contained folder; the only shared files a new app
> edits — `index.tsx`, `apps.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` — are all **append-only**.
> Add new entries at the **end** of each list/table, never reorder existing ones,
> and touch only your own app's lines. Before opening/finalizing a PR,
> `git fetch && git merge origin/main`, resolve any shared-file overlap by
> *keeping every app's entries*, and re-run `npm run build`. Merge order doesn't
> matter — the re-sync is cheap because the edits are additive. See
> **docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md §8** for the full workflow.

### Branch sync (don't pull `main` at session start)

The repo is **cloned fresh each session** and your working branch is already
checked out, so there is nothing to "catch up" before you begin. **Do not
`git pull` / `git merge origin/main` at the start of a session** — it pulls
unrelated work into your diff and triggers premature conflicts in the append-only
shared files (`index.tsx`, `apps.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`).

Sync with `main` **only when finalizing a PR** — the single prescribed point
(`git fetch && git merge origin/main`, keep every app's entries, re-run
`npm run build`; see the parallel-branches note above and **BUILDING_AN_APP.md §8**)
— and only if your branch actually targets `main`.

### Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers the **Deploy demo** GitHub Pages workflow
(`npm ci && npm run build`, uploads `dist/`); it also accepts manual dispatch.
For per-PR preview URLs, see `docs/PREVIEW_DEPLOYS.md`.

### Agent session skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Three Claude Code skills support the session workflow. Both a human (typing the
slash command) and an agent (via the Skill tool) can invoke them; they are
invoked **on explicit request**, not auto-triggered spontaneously:

- **`/start-session`** — reads the latest handoff, opens a progress report, and
  orients (branch + which app, the append-only parallel-branch rule). Run it first.
- **`/handoff`** — distills the session into a handoff doc; uses `npm run build`
  (the only CI check) for status and appends the self-reflection protocol.
- **`/three-hats <plan>`** — reviews a plan/design from three lenses (framework
  maintainer · architecture consultant · math-viz & pedagogy) in parallel, then
  synthesizes.

Progress reports and handoffs are **committed** as **Markdown + YAML frontmatter**
under `docs/sessions/{progress,handoff}/<branch-slug>/` — partitioned **per branch**
so parallel branches never collide. Forward-looking, app-specific implementation
plans are reports too: **`kind: plan`** files in the branch's `progress/` folder
(`status: proposed` until a session executes them), surfaced by the control center
like any report (the slug is the branch name with `claude/`
stripped and `/`→`-`; keep branch names short and topical). The style is specified
by `docs/sessions/REPORT_STYLE.md`; skills copy the `docs/sessions/_template-*.md`
skeletons. Markdown reads natively on GitHub, and **`npm run sessions`**
(`docs/sessions/build-sessions.mjs`) renders every branch's reports into the rich
HTML view (`report.css` + `report.js`: timeline rail, sticky scroll-spy TOC,
callouts, sortable tables) and builds a **cross-branch control center**
(`docs/sessions/control-center.html`) that aggregates every active branch's reports
into one searchable index. The control center has three views — **Cards** ·
**Timeline** · **Reflections** — plus a **category filter** bar whose active
selection lives in the URL as `#cat=<key>` (shareable; app chips everywhere link to
it). The **Reflections** view is an *exit-interview digest*: it scrapes each report's
`## Self-reflection` section and its `**Follow-up value:** <LEVEL>` line, sorting
entries by follow-up severity — so authoring that section in the exact format from
`.claude/prompts/self-reflection.md` is what feeds it (`categories.mjs` holds the
category taxonomy). The build reads branch tips read-only (never modifies other
branches), deduping each report to its most-recently-updated copy with provenance
taken from the slug folder. The converter `docs/sessions/convert-html.mjs` turns the
older hand-authored HTML reports into Markdown. On deploy (`deploy.yml` runs
`npm run sessions` then `copy-sessions-to-dist.mjs`) the hub ships to
`/animath/sessions/control-center.html` (`noindex`, off to the side) and links out to
the embed demo (`/animath/embed-demo.html`). The shared self-reflection protocol lives
at `.claude/prompts/self-reflection.md`.
