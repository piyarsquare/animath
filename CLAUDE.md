# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide for animath

## Project Overview

**animath** is a modular, browser-based toolkit for mathematical animations and
generative art, built with TypeScript, React 18, Three.js, and Vite. It is
deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages at `https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/`.

Every animation ("app") is a self-contained module that plugs into the shared
**workspace chrome** (`src/chrome/`, specified by `docs/redesign/DESIGN-SPEC.md`):
a landing **gallery** opens into a per-app **workspace** where the plot(s) and
the control panels are draggable windows on a dotted stage, opened from a left
icon rail whose icons come from a closed 11-archetype vocabulary. Five **skins**
restyle everything via one `data-theme` attribute; below 740px the workspace
re-chromes into a phone UI (stacked view cards, bottom dock, bottom sheets).
Apps declare themselves in a single registry (`src/apps.ts`) and pass their
panels/views to one `<Workspace>` component, so the chrome stays uniform across
every view.

## Quick Reference

```bash
npm ci              # install dependencies (use ci, not install, for reproducibility)
npm run dev         # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173/animath/
npm run build       # TypeScript check + Vite production build → dist/
npm run preview     # preview production build locally
npm test            # vitest unit tests (chrome workspace pure logic)
npm run lint        # eslint over src/ (keep it at 0 errors)
```

Node >= 20, npm >= 10 required. The only CI check is `npm run build` (which runs
`tsc && vite build`). Unit tests cover the chrome's pure logic (`npm test`,
vitest, `src/**/__tests__/`). ESLint is configured (`eslint.config.mjs`,
lint-only — deliberately **no formatter**: a repo-wide reformat would conflict
with every in-flight parallel branch).

- **README.md** — user-facing tour of the apps, the shell, and interaction conventions.
- **docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md** — step-by-step guide (for humans *and* agents) to
  adding a new app that conforms to the framework. **Read this before adding a module.**
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — a historical design/consolidation proposal. Useful for
  background, but it describes a *proposed* structure that differs from what was
  actually built; treat the layout below as the source of truth.

Third person uses a **cutaway clip plane** (a single world plane a gap in front of the camera — the **Cutaway** slider sets that gap as a fraction of the camera→character distance, clamped just short so it never reaches the character — perpendicular to the camera→character line; every cover material shares it by reference except the floor, which stays whole; avatars are outside coverRoot so never clip) so the near wall the camera pokes through is clipped away and the avatar is never buried; empty in first person. Invariants: H₁ from the deck group's abelianization (lib/freeness.ts: point group + Reidemeister–Schreier lattice → Smith form) — the authoritative, screw-safe H₁ — plus a free-action test certifying a genuine manifold (vs a cone-point orbifold); the cube cell complex (lib/homology.ts) is kept for χ and as an independent cross-check — all 8 worlds are now dual-verified (the 2026-06-20 screw fix: glue by the whole in-cube orbit + a finer subdivision for screw worlds; see SolidWorlds/SCREW_BUG.md). View panel also has a **Decor** switch (Diagnostic ↔ Rooms): the Rooms mode (decor/rooms.ts) furnishes the fundamental cube as a recognizable room — rug, desk+lamp, fireplace (+logs/ember glow), framed pictures, ceiling chandelier, a Hello sign over the mantel, plus a bookshelf (colored spines) on the +z wall and a wardrobe on the +x wall so the formerly-bare back walls are furnished too (all emissive-only "light", no real point lights, which would multiply across the cover and fight the holonomy-symmetrized lighting) — inside **solid-but-faintly-translucent walls** (faint axis tint X warm · Y green · Z blue; opacity is the **Wall opacity** slider, default 0.84, with depthWrite ON so the tiled panels don't flicker, yet a hint of the copies glows through — engine keeps live wall-material refs so the slider updates without a rebuild) whose room-to-room connections are **off-center archways**: each of the three −axis faces is a solid panel (ShapeGeometry) with one arched opening (the floor/ceiling a hole), framed by an extruded **arch-molding casing** (jambs + arched header proud of the wall; a low torus rim around the trapdoor) so the opening reads as built architecture; each wall also carries a steel-framed **ceiling duct** (a slot running up to the ceiling in the opposite corner, open at the top edge as the arch is open at the floor) — distinct from the arched doorways — so worlds that flip the room top↔bottom keep a foot-level transit opening (the gluing carries the ceiling duct down to floor level in the flipped copy, so you cross through the duct instead of clipping blank wall while the arch hangs from the ceiling); the +axis faces are supplied by neighbors via the cover instancing, so a far wall's opening is your near opening carried by that pairing's gluing — off-center so the turn/mirror is visible (centered would be fixed by it), and in worlds tipping vertical↔horizontal the ceiling hole lands where a wall arch was (chandelier on a wall). No g-math in the decor: drawing only the −axis faces lets the deck instancing transport them. Solid walls stage the surprise (you don't see the next room until you step through). Textures in textures.ts (rugTexture/pictureTexture/signTexture). Default cover depth is 1 (a calm single room; slider →10 for the deep hall) — depth 3 read as far too busy. Earlier passes: faint-frame "doorless" walls (arrows on walls — removed as unhelpful), and before that interior architecture (glass walls/spiral stairs — too cluttered). Visual/design layer only, no engine-math change

## Routing

The app uses a **hand-rolled hash router** in `src/index.tsx`. Every route is
`React.lazy`-imported (code-split) and rendered **bare** — each app owns its
chrome by rendering `<Workspace>`. The route table is keyed by hash; the
visible app catalog comes from `src/apps.ts` (+ `src/chrome/catalog.ts`).

| Hash Route            | Component        | Description                                |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `#/` (default)       | `Gallery`        | Landing gallery of all apps                 |
| `#/complex-particles`| `App → ComplexParticles` | 4D complex-function particle viewer |
| `#/plane-transform`  | `PlaneTransform` | f as a transformation of the plane (one split view window: domain · image) |
| `#/fractals`         | `FractalsGPU`    | GPU Mandelbrot / Julia / Burning Ship / Tricorn |
| `#/fractals-cpu`     | `Fractals2D`     | Legacy CPU 2D fractals (unlisted)           |
| `#/correspondence`   | `Correspondence` | Mandelbrot ↔ Julia, two linked view windows |
| `#/topology-walk`    | `TopologyWalk`   | **Unlisted** (being retired; superseded by Polygon Worlds, which absorbed its scene looks). First-person walk on a closed surface (twisting Möbius corridor / flat torus / Klein); still URL-reachable, `#/mobius` and `#/wrap-world` redirect here |
| `#/trinary`          | `Trinary`        | Three-star system: Observatory + Lab as top-bar modes (`#/trinary-lab` opens the Lab) |
| `#/stable-marriage`  | `StableMarriage` | Gale–Shapley algorithm + heatmap lab        |
| `#/agentic-sorting`  | `AgenticSorting` | Concurrent agent-based sorting              |
| `#/stable-matching`  | `StableMatching` | Rebuilt Gale–Shapley lab (matrix · welfare surface · lattice via layouts) |
| `#/polygon-worlds`   | `PolygonWorlds`  | Walk every closed surface from one glued polygon |
| `#/trees-and-nets`   | `TreesAndNets`   | Tree-space as a polytope: the associahedron of an n-gon's triangulations (port of the private `quantum-tree`) |
| `#/solid-worlds`     | `SolidWorlds`    | Walk inside a closed 3-manifold built from one glued cube (3D successor to Polygon Worlds); Tier 1 flat worlds + chirality HUD |
| `#/embed/complex-particles` | `EmbedComplexParticles` | Chrome-less applet for iframe embedding, URL-configured (docs/EMBEDS.md); demo host: `/embed-demo.html` |
| `#/embed/plane-transform` | `EmbedPlaneTransform` | Chrome-less two-pane plane applet for iframe embedding (docs/EMBEDS.md) |

Unknown hashes fall back to the `Gallery`. **`src/apps.ts` is the single source
of truth** for the user-visible catalog (order, name, icon, blurb); the gallery
adds per-card metadata (category, preview kind) in `src/chrome/catalog.ts`.
When you add an app you update the `routes` map in `index.tsx`, the `apps`
array in `apps.ts`, **and** the `META` map in `chrome/catalog.ts`.

## The workspace framework

`src/chrome/` renders the global chrome (full spec: `docs/redesign/DESIGN-SPEC.md`;
control inventory mapping: `docs/redesign/PARAM-MAP.md`). An app integrates by
rendering **one component**:

```tsx
<Workspace
  appId="my-app"            // persistence namespace (localStorage ws:<appId>)
  title={name} subtitle={formula}
  sections={sections}       // SectionDef[] — the control panels
  views={views}             // ViewDef[] — the plot window(s)
  layouts={layouts}         // optional built-in layouts (+ auto Compact/Everything)
  defaultLayoutId="essentials"
  explainer={markdown}      // the "?" modal (EXPLAINER.md [+ '---' + README.md])
  modes={…} activeMode={…} onModeChange={…}  // optional top-bar mode pills
/>
```

- `SectionDef = { id, title, arch, node, estHeight? }` — `arch` is one of the
  **closed 11-archetype vocabulary** (`chrome/workspace/archetypes.ts`):
  Define `subject`/`domain` · Render `view`/`color`/`marks`/`motion` · Drive
  `drive`/`playback` · Analyze `lab`/`readout` · System `quality`. The rail
  sorts by tier; never invent new icons — propose vocabulary changes in
  `docs/redesign/IN-PROGRESS.md`.
- `ViewDef = { id, title, defaultRect } + (node | panes)` — the node fills a
  draggable, resizable, collapsible window body (`position:absolute; inset:0`);
  `panes: PaneDef[]` instead renders a **split view** (two pictures, one
  window, fixed equal split — Plane Transform's domain/image pair). Collapsed
  views are hidden, **never unmounted**, so WebGL state survives (`Canvas3D`
  ignores zero-size resizes). A header button takes any view **full screen**
  (CSS-only restyle of the same node — the WebGL context survives; Esc or the
  button restores); on phone, cards also height-resize from a bottom grip.
  While fullscreen, the rail stays live and panels float above; apps with
  primary verbs pass `actions` (the always-on strip, ≤5 buttons projecting a
  drive/playback panel). A single-view app can also pass `immersive` to make
  that one view fill the stage below the top bar (frameless, no dotted void),
  with the rail, floating panels and action strip overlaid — the desktop twin
  of the phone solo view, used by Polygon Worlds for its first-person walk.
- `LayoutDef.views[id].open: false` hides a view in that layout (how
  Stable Matching's matrix/welfare/lattice and Trinary's Lab instruments
  present as layouts).
- The top bar carries the brand-mark **Home** (gallery is the only hub), the
  `Layout:` menu, optional mode pills, the **?** explainer and the SkinPicker.
- Analyze-tier panels should use the shared readout primitives from
  `chrome/readouts.tsx` (Breakdown / MiniHisto / Sparkline / StatGrid / Kicker).
- Apps with window-level key handlers (first-person walkers) must early-return
  when `document.activeElement` is a form control, so typing in panels doesn't
  drive the scene.

### Control primitives (import from `components/ControlPanel`)

`Slider`, `Pills` (segmented buttons), `Select` (dropdown), `Checkbox`,
`RangeSlider`, `NumberInput` (+ a legacy `Section`). These are the standard
building blocks for panel bodies, styled by `ControlPanel.css` on the theme
tokens (`--cp-*` vars alias `--fg`/`--accent`/…). Use them instead of
hand-rolling inputs so every app looks consistent.

## Architecture Patterns

### Anatomy of an app

Each app lives in `src/animations/<Name>/` and typically contains:

- A main `.tsx` component (the whole animation + its controls).
- `EXPLAINER.md` — short "what am I looking at" text for the **?** popup (`?raw`);
  shipped by nearly every app.
- `README.md` — *optional* longer write-up for the **About** section
  (`import md from './README.md?raw'`). `ParticleViewerShell` viewers render it
  automatically; custom apps render it if they choose, and some (e.g. the Trinary
  System) ship none.
- Optional helper `.ts` modules — pull simulation/algorithm logic and data out of
  the component (e.g. `physics.ts` + `presets.ts`, or `corridorGeometry.ts`).
- Optional `shaders/` directory (GLSL kept as inline template strings).
- Optional `.css` for CSS/DOM apps.

Inside the component, an app: (1) holds its own state with `useState`/`useRef`
(+ `usePersistentState` for settings); (2) defines its `SectionDef[]` panels
(bodies built from the `ControlPanel` primitives) and `ViewDef[]` view
window(s); (3) renders `<Workspace appId title subtitle sections views layouts
explainer>`. The scene (Three.js via `Canvas3D`, or DOM/CSS) is the view node.

### Three.js / particle (4D) viewers

The complex viewers are powered by the **`src/lib/particles` engine** plus the
turnkey `ParticleViewerShell` component, which together provide the standard
**Function / Domain / Camera / Color / Render / Motion / 4D Rotation / System**
panels (the `QuarterTurnControls` live in the drive-tier 4D Rotation panel),
gesture handling, and the rAF loop out of the box. The flow is:
`useParticleState` (state) → `useViewControls` (orientation/projection
controls) → build geometry/axes in `Canvas3D`'s `onMount` (which **must return
the cleanup** that stops the loop and disposes the scene — `startAnimationLoop`
returns the stop function) → `useUniformSync` pushes React state into shader
uniforms → `startAnimationLoop` runs the rAF loop.
**ComplexParticles is the canonical consumer** — though no longer a *simple*
one (it orchestrates per-branch materials across four render modes); copy its
shell wiring when building a new particle viewer and skip the multi-sheet
material plumbing unless you need it.

### 2D / fractal viewers

FractalsGPU and Correspondence render shader quads through orthographic cameras
inside their view windows and navigate with `useViewportGestures` (drag-pan,
pinch/wheel-zoom, tap). Palettes come from `lib/colormaps.ts`. Correspondence's
two linked windows are the two-view reference.

### CSS/DOM apps

StableMarriage, StableMatching and AgenticSorting render plain DOM with
`lucide-react` icons and their own CSS inside view windows; their controls live
in workspace panels like everyone else's. StableMatching shows how in-app tabs
become **layouts** (`views[id].open`).

## Interaction conventions

Particle viewers split **looking** (gestures) from **navigating** (buttons):

- **1-finger / mouse drag** orbits the camera (never the 4D rotation). The
  Camera panel's **Orbit** toggle picks the style: **Turntable** (default) is
  the bounded orbit — azimuth around world-up, elevation clamped at the poles,
  so "up" stays up and the view is easy to recenter by hand — and **Free** is
  the unbounded trackball that tumbles past the poles and can roll.
- **2-finger drag** pans the look-at target; on desktop, **right-drag**,
  **held `Space`+drag** or `Shift`+drag pan (the phone keeps a Drag
  Orbit | Pan pill for one-finger choice).
- **2-finger pinch / wheel** zooms.
- **QuarterTurnControls** (the drive-tier **4D Rotation** panel, draggable
  beside the plot): tap a ↻/↺ button for a single **eighth turn**
  (45°); the small toggle under each button starts/stops a **continuous spin** in
  that plane and direction (multiple compose, e.g. xy + uv = an isoclinic double
  rotation). One **Spin speed** slider sets the rate. Includes reset + drop-axis.
  The rows are **context-sensitive**: in the nonlinear **Hopf/Torus**
  projections (where a 4D turn deforms the image), they switch to three ambient
  **Yaw / Pitch / Roll** controls that orbit the 3D camera rigidly instead of
  rotating the 4D pre-image; the six 4D planes return in the linear projections.

Fractal viewers: drag to pan, pinch/wheel to zoom, and **Trace mode** (the
drive-tier Trace panel) spawns an iteration orbit from a tapped point.

Workspace windows: drag by the **header** (canvas gestures stay inside the
window body); resize view windows from the bottom-right handle; any
pointer-down raises a window; collapse from the header chevron. Arrangements
are saved via the top-bar **Layout** menu and persist per app.

### Projection modes (Complex Particles)

A 4D point `(x, y, u, v)` maps to 3D via the **projection slider** with three
sticky, labeled stops — **Perspective** (divide by `3 + v`) ⇠ **Torus**
(stereographic from the +v pole, soft-floored; the old "Stereo" was this same
map and was retired) ⇢ **Sphere** (the Hopf view; `ProjectionMode.Hopf`
internally) — where fractional positions are live GPU morphs, the 4D axis
cross fades out toward the torus (the scaffold takes over), and the
Torus→Sphere leg is the fiber collapse. **Drop X / Y / U / V** (discard the
named axis) remains on the 4D Rotation panel.

## Code Conventions

- **TypeScript strict mode**; functional components with hooks only.
- **Path alias** `@/` → `src/` (in both `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`).
  Note: many files still use relative `../../` imports — both work; match the file
  you're editing.
- **State** is local `useState`/`useRef` only (no global store/context; the
  workspace owns only window/layout state, persisted per app under `ws:<appId>`,
  and the skin under `chrome:skin`).
- **Persisted settings**: `usePersistentState(key, initial)` (`lib/usePersistentState.ts`)
  is a drop-in `useState` that mirrors to `localStorage` (namespaced
  `animath:<version>:<app>:<field>`), so a user's controls survive a reload. Pass
  `key = null` to opt out. The particle viewers persist through
  `useParticleState({ storageKey })`; `clearPersistedState(namespace)` powers the
  "Reset settings to defaults" action. Persist *settings*, not transient view
  state (camera orbit/pan) or derived values.
- **Shaders**: GLSL as inline template strings under per-app `shaders/`.
- **Markdown**: `README.md` (About) and `EXPLAINER.md` (?) imported via `?raw`.
- **Base-aware asset paths**: load public assets with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
  (the Vite `base` is `/animath/`) — see `lib/textures.ts`.
- **Spelling — American English throughout**: all user-facing text and comments
  (UI strings, `README.md`/`EXPLAINER.md`, code comments) use American spellings —
  **color** (not colour), **center** (not centre), **behavior**, **gray**,
  **favor**, **neighbor**, **analyze**, and **-ize/-ization** verb endings
  (organize, minimize, normalize, stabilize, visualize). This matches the language
  defaults already used in code (CSS `color:`, `justify-content: center`; JS
  `normalize()`), so code and prose stay uniform. When merging a branch that
  introduced British prose, normalize it back to American.

## Attribution & AI collaboration

These apps are built in collaboration with AI collaborators (see
[`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md) for the full policy). Ideas are often reached by
independent reasoning, but few are new to the world — and the collaborators are
trained on a vast, largely uncredited corpus. So **identifying an app's possible
sources is a standing part of building it**, even when none were in mind while the
idea was worked out:

- Each app's `EXPLAINER.md` (or guide page) ends with a short **"Possible sources
  & where to go further"** block — annotated pointers to prior work and analogues,
  framed as a reader's next step, **not** a priority claim. This is wayfinding as
  much as credit.
- **Name what you can stand behind; flag uncertainty — never fabricate** a
  citation, DOI, or date. A vaguer-but-true pointer beats a crisp fabricated one.
- Record both provenances honestly: how an idea was *reached* and what it *lands
  near* (with a name) are different questions; keep both.
- Sessions note possible sources surfaced during the work in their handoff, so
  attributions are captured while fresh.

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

Much of the old debt has been paid down: the three near-identical complex viewers
were consolidated into the `lib/particles` engine + `ParticleViewerShell` (Roots
and Multibranch are now modes of ComplexParticles); complex math lives in
`lib/complexMath.ts`; texture factories in `lib/textures.ts`; code splitting is in
place via `React.lazy`; the HDR texture path is now `base`-aware; touch/gesture
support exists across the 3D, 2D, and DOM apps; and the former orphan `Fractals2D`
is reachable at `#/fractals-cpu`.

The 2026-06-11 debt session cleared the long-standing list: ESLint adopted
(`npm run lint`, 0 errors; lint-only — no formatter, by decision), the orphaned
utilities (`lib/ParticleDisplay.ts`, `lib/R2Mapping.ts`, `src/materials/`) and
empty stubs (`requirements.txt`, `run/setup.sh`) deleted, `Readme.tsx` output
sanitized with DOMPurify, the stale `PLAN.md` replaced by the prioritized
roadmap, and the deploy-workflow duplicate step confirmed already fixed.

Remaining items:

1. **CI runs only `npm run build`** — `npm test` and `npm run lint` are not CI
   gates yet; keep them green by convention. Lint carries ~60 warnings
   (`exhaustive-deps`, `no-explicit-any`) accepted as the baseline — don't add
   new ones.
2. **`npm audit`: 2 moderate dev-only advisories** (esbuild via vite ^5; affects
   the local dev server only). The fix is a breaking vite major upgrade —
   scheduled as its own chore in `PLAN.md`, not bolted onto another change.
3. **`ARCHITECTURE.md` is historical** — it proposes a `core/widgets/ui` layout
   that was not adopted (banner at its top says so); the actual shared code
   lives in `components/` and `lib/`.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a new app

Follow **docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md**. In short:

1. Create `src/animations/MyApp/MyApp.tsx` (+ `README.md`, `EXPLAINER.md`).
2. Register the route in `src/index.tsx` (`React.lazy` import + `routes` entry).
3. Register the catalog entry in `src/apps.ts` (`hash`, `name`, `icon`, `blurb`)
   **and** its gallery metadata (category + preview kind) in `src/chrome/catalog.ts`.
4. Define `SectionDef[]` panels (archetypes from the closed vocabulary) and
   `ViewDef[]` view window(s), then render `<Workspace appId … />` with panel
   bodies built from the `ControlPanel` primitives. For 4D particle viewers,
   build on `ParticleViewerShell` + `lib/particles` (copy ComplexParticles).
5. Document *your* app: add its row to the **Routing** table above and a line to
   the repository-layout tree (and to `README.md`). Append — don't reorder.
6. `npm run build` must pass.

> **Parallel branches.** Several app branches are often in flight at once
> (frequently in separate agent threads). The framework keeps that conflict-free
> because each app is a self-contained folder; the only shared files a new app
> edits — `index.tsx`, `apps.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` — are all **append-only**.
> Add new entries at the **end** of each list/table, never reorder existing ones,
> and touch only your own app's lines. Before opening/finalizing a PR,
> `git fetch && git merge origin/main`, resolve any shared-file overlap by
> *keeping every app's entries*, and re-run `npm run build`. Merge order doesn't
> matter — the re-sync is cheap because the edits are additive. See
> **docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md §8** for the full workflow.

### Branch sync (don't pull `main` at session start)

The repo is **cloned fresh each session** and your working branch is already
checked out, so there is nothing to "catch up" before you begin. **Do not
`git pull` / `git merge origin/main` at the start of a session** — it pulls
unrelated work into your diff and triggers premature conflicts in the append-only
shared files (`index.tsx`, `apps.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`).

Sync with `main` **only when finalizing a PR** — the single prescribed point
(`git fetch && git merge origin/main`, keep every app's entries, re-run
`npm run build`; see the parallel-branches note above and **BUILDING_AN_APP.md §8**)
— and only if your branch actually targets `main`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If your branch is stacked on another feature branch** (created from
> `claude/<other>` rather than `main`), sync against **that base**, never `main` —
> merging `main` would drag in work your branch was never meant to carry. Check your
> base with `git merge-base` / the branch you forked from if unsure.

### Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers the **Deploy demo** GitHub Pages workflow
(`npm ci && npm run build`, uploads `dist/`); it also accepts manual dispatch.
For per-PR preview URLs, see `docs/PREVIEW_DEPLOYS.md`.

### Agent session skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Three Claude Code skills support the session workflow. Both a human (typing the
slash command) and an agent (via the Skill tool) can invoke them; they are
invoked **on explicit request**, not auto-triggered spontaneously:

- **`/start-session`** — reads the latest handoff, opens a progress report, and
  orients (branch + which app, the append-only parallel-branch rule). Run it first.
- **`/handoff`** — distills the session into a handoff doc; uses `npm run build`
  (the only CI check) for status and appends the self-reflection protocol.
- **`/three-hats <plan>`** — reviews a plan/design from three lenses (framework
  maintainer · architecture consultant · math-viz & pedagogy) in parallel, then
  synthesizes.

Progress reports and handoffs are **committed** as **Markdown + YAML frontmatter**
under `docs/sessions/{progress,handoff}/<branch-slug>/` — partitioned **per branch**
so parallel branches never collide. Forward-looking, app-specific implementation
plans are reports too: **`kind: plan`** files in the branch's `progress/` folder
(`status: proposed` until a session executes them), surfaced by the control center
like any report (the slug is the branch name with `claude/`
stripped and `/`→`-`; keep branch names short and topical). The style is specified
by `docs/sessions/REPORT_STYLE.md`; skills copy the `docs/sessions/_template-*.md`
skeletons. Markdown reads natively on GitHub, and **`npm run sessions`**
(`docs/sessions/build-sessions.mjs`) renders every branch's reports into the rich
HTML view (`report.css` + `report.js`: timeline rail, sticky scroll-spy TOC,
callouts, sortable tables) and builds a **cross-branch control center**
(`docs/sessions/control-center.html`) that aggregates every active branch's reports
into one searchable index. The control center has three views — **Cards** ·
**Timeline** · **Reflections** — plus a **category filter** bar whose active
selection lives in the URL as `#cat=<key>` (shareable; app chips everywhere link to
it). The **Reflections** view is an *exit-interview digest*: it scrapes each report's
`## Self-reflection` section and its `**Follow-up value:** <LEVEL>` line, sorting
entries by follow-up severity — so authoring that section in the exact format from
`.claude/prompts/self-reflection.md` is what feeds it (`categories.mjs` holds the
category taxonomy). The build reads branch tips read-only (never modifies other
branches), deduping each report to its most-recently-updated copy with provenance
taken from the slug folder. The converter `docs/sessions/convert-html.mjs` turns the
older hand-authored HTML reports into Markdown. On deploy (`deploy.yml` runs
`npm run sessions` then `copy-sessions-to-dist.mjs`) the hub ships to
`/animath/sessions/control-center.html` (`noindex`, off to the side) and links out to
the embed demo (`/animath/embed-demo.html`). The shared self-reflection protocol lives
at `.claude/prompts/self-reflection.md`.
