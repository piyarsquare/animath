# Plan

1. Create `AGENTS.md` summarizing repository guidelines derived from `README.md`.
2. Add `requirements.txt` for potential Python tools (currently empty placeholder).
3. Add `/run/setup.sh` script to demonstrate environment setup.
4. Document the installation steps in `AGENTS.md` and ensure the script can be run with `pip install -r requirements.txt && npm install && ./run/setup.sh`.
5. Introduce a generic `R2Mapping` utility for mapping ℝ² → ℝ².
6. Provide a demo component using selectable mappings and adjustable appearance.
7. Expose the new demo via a hash route so it appears on GitHub Pages.
