## 1‚ÄÇWhat is animath?

`animath` is a TypeScript/React + WebGL (Three.js) code-base designed for **rapid prototyping of mathematical visuals**.  
It began with complex-analysis ‚Äúdomain colouring‚Äù but is meant to grow into a **general playground**: fractals, differential-equation flows, algebraic surfaces, knot animations, and more.

Goals (observable intent):

* **Self-contained** ‚Äì runs in any modern browser; no server component required.  
* **Composable** ‚Äì each animation is an isolated React component with its own GLSL shaders, props, and UI controls.  
* **Pedagogical** ‚Äì clear code, extensive comments, and references to underlying maths.  
* **Art-friendly** ‚Äì export stills, GIF loops, and high-resolution renders.

## Material library

`animath` collects reusable Three.js material presets (found under
`src/materials/`). These define common shading styles‚Äîsuch as translucent
sprites or reflective glass‚Äîthat can be imported by any animation. The goal is
to simplify experimenting with different looks without rewriting shader logic.

## 3‚ÄÇQuick start

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/<USER>/animath.git
cd animath
npm ci          # reproducible install

# Live-reload dev server
npm run dev     # ‚Üí http://localhost:5173
````

Production build & local preview:

```bash
npm run build   # outputs static files to dist/
npx serve dist  # quick sanity check
```

Node ‚â• 20, npm ‚â• 10 recommended.

To publish the live demo on GitHub Pages, trigger the `Deploy demo` workflow
manually from the repository's Actions tab.

## 5‚ÄÇCreating a new animation

PROJECTED EXAMPLE OF WORKFLOW, OPEN TO REVIISION.
1. `mkdir src/animations/myCoolThing`
2. Implement `<MyCoolThing/>` extending the `Canvas3D` wrapper.
3. Add route entry in `src/index.tsx`.
4. Provide a `README.md` inside the folder explaining the maths.

*Tip:* Keep GLSL strings inline for zero-fetch builds; use `vite-plugin-glsl` if you prefer external files.

### Projection modes

The renderer supports several ways of mapping a 4‚ÄëD point `(x,y,u,v)` to 3‚ÄëD:

1. **Perspective** ‚Äì divide by `3 + v`.
2. **Stereo** ‚Äì stereographic projection from the +v pole.
3. **Hopf** ‚Äì Hopf fibration assuming a unit hypersphere.
4. **DropX** ‚Äì ignore the x component.
5. **DropY** ‚Äì ignore the y component.
6. **DropU** ‚Äì ignore the u component.
7. **DropV** ‚Äì ignore the v component.

Switching modes interpolates on the GPU for a smooth transition.

## Controls

* Six **Quarter-Turn** buttons perform smooth 90¬∞ rotations in the XY, XU, XV, YU, YV, and UV planes; combine them for any orthogonal orientation before you drop an axis.
