# animath

> *Animated mathematics for curious minds* — a modular, browser-based toolkit for creating, sharing, and exploring mathematical animations and generative art.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/">Live demo</a>
</p>

The landing page (`#/`) is a gallery of every app; the cards below are also
reachable directly by hash route.

1. **[Complex Particles](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/complex-particles)** – 3D representation of four-dimensional complex functions. Includes the former *Complex Roots* (`z^(p/q)`) and *Complex Multibranch* (multi-sheeted maps for `sqrt`, `ln`, etc.) as built-in modes.
2. **[Plane Transform](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/plane-transform)** – watch a complex function `f : ℂ → ℂ` warp a coloured grid of the plane, input pane beside output pane.
3. **[Fractals](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/fractals)** – GPU-accelerated Mandelbrot / Julia / Burning Ship / Tricorn viewer with optional orbit-tracing mode.
4. **[Correspondence](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/correspondence)** – side-by-side Mandelbrot–Julia explorer; pick or draw paths through `c`.
5. **[Möbius Walk](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/mobius)** – first-person stroll through a twisted corridor.
6. **[Stable Marriage](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/stable-marriage)** – step through the Gale–Shapley algorithm with bias and consensus controls.
7. **[Agentic Sorting](https://piyarsquare.github.io/animath/#/agentic-sorting)** – concurrent sorting simulation where autonomous agents with distinct strategies produce emergent order.

## 1 What is animath?

`animath` is a TypeScript + React + Three.js codebase for **rapid prototyping
of mathematical visuals**. It started as a domain-colouring playground for
complex analysis and is growing into a general toolkit: fractals,
differential-equation flows, algebraic surfaces, sorting and matching
algorithms, and more.

Goals:

* **Self-contained** — runs in any modern browser; no server component.
* **Composable** — each app is an isolated React module with its own shaders
  and UI.
* **Pedagogical** — clear code and per-app README pages explaining the maths.
* **Mobile-friendly** — every app works on a phone with touch gestures.

---

## 2 The app shell

The default route (`#/`) is a **landing menu** — a gallery of cards, one per
app. Every other route is wrapped in a persistent `AppShell` that provides a top
bar with these buttons (left to right):

* **⌂ Home** — back to the landing menu (hidden on the menu itself).
* **☰ Apps** — opens the drawer's Apps tab to switch animations.
* **ƒ Function** — switch the active function/variant where an app offers one
  (dimmed otherwise).
* **Title** — the current app's name plus an optional monospace formula;
  clicking it jumps to the Settings tab.
* **⚙ Settings** — the app's parameter controls.
* **▶ Actions** — one-shot actions (reset, modes, …); these are mirrored into a
  draggable on-canvas floater.
* **? Explainer** — a "what am I looking at?" popup with a short write-up.

Buttons for tabs an app doesn't populate are dimmed. The shell also adds iOS
safe-area padding so the bottom of the screen stays visible behind Safari's URL
bar and the home indicator.

The Complex Particles viewer adds a small floating **quarter-turn** cluster in
the bottom-left corner of the canvas for direct 4D plane rotations (tap for 90°,
hold for continuous rotation).

## 3 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyarsquare/animath.git
cd animath
npm ci          # reproducible install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173/animath/
```

Production build & preview:

```bash
npm run build           # outputs static files to dist/
npx vite preview        # serves dist/ at http://localhost:4173/animath/
```

Node ≥ 20, npm ≥ 10 recommended.

### Deploying

Pushes to `main` automatically trigger the **Deploy demo** workflow, which
publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages. The workflow also accepts manual dispatch
from the Actions tab.

For per-PR preview URLs (so you can test a branch on your phone without
merging to `main`), see [docs/PREVIEW_DEPLOYS.md](./docs/PREVIEW_DEPLOYS.md).

## 5 Adding a new animation

The full, copy-pasteable walkthrough lives in
[docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md](./docs/BUILDING_AN_APP.md). The short version:

1. Create `src/animations/MyAnimation/MyAnimation.tsx`, plus a `README.md`
   (the in-app **About** section) and `EXPLAINER.md` (the **?** popup), both
   loaded via `import md from './README.md?raw'`.
2. Register the lazy route in `src/index.tsx`:
   ```ts
   const MyAnimation = React.lazy(() => import('./animations/MyAnimation/MyAnimation'));
   const routes = {
     // …existing routes…
     '/my-animation': MyAnimation,
   };
   ```
3. Register the catalogue entry in `src/apps.ts` (this drives both the drawer's
   Apps tab and the landing menu):
   ```ts
   export const apps: AppDescriptor[] = [
     // …existing entries…
     { hash: '/my-animation', name: 'My Animation', icon: '◆', blurb: 'One-line teaser.' },
   ];
   ```
4. Inside the component, call `useAppHeader('My Animation', 'optional formula')`
   and `useAppExplainer(explainerText)`, then render `<ShellSettings>` /
   `<ShellActions>` for controls (built from the `ControlPanel` primitives).

Three.js animations can wrap `Canvas3D`. For particle-style 4D viewers,
`ParticleViewerShell` plus the `src/lib/particles` hooks gives you the
default Function / Camera / Colour / Particles / Motion / Detail / About
sections out of the box — see ComplexParticles for the simplest example.

GLSL is kept inline as template strings in `shaders/index.ts` per app for
zero-fetch builds.

## 6 Interaction conventions

The particle viewers use a clean split between **looking** (gestures) and
**navigating** (buttons):

* **1-finger / mouse drag** orbits the camera around the look-at point.
  Never touches the 4D rotation.
* **2-finger drag** (or `Shift` + drag) pans the look-at target.
* **2-finger pinch** / **mouse wheel** zooms.
* **Quarter-turn floater** (bottom-left of the canvas) — tap a plane button
  for a 90° animated turn, **hold** for continuous rotation. Includes a
  "Reset orientation" row.

The fractal viewers use:

* **Drag** to pan, **pinch** or **wheel** to zoom.
* **Trace mode** (toggle in the Actions drawer) — when on, taps spawn an
  iteration orbit from the tap point.

---

## 7 Projection modes (Complex Particles)

The renderer maps a 4D point `(x, y, u, v)` to 3D using one of:

1. **Perspective** — divide by `3 + v`.
2. **Stereo** — stereographic projection from the +v pole.
3. **Hopf** — Hopf fibration assuming a unit hypersphere.
4. **Drop X / Y / U / V** — discard the named axis.

Switching modes interpolates on the GPU for a smooth transition.
