## 1‚ÄÇWhat is animath?

`animath` is a TypeScript/React + WebGL (Three.js) code-base designed for **rapid prototyping of mathematical visuals**.  
It began with complex-analysis ‚Äúdomain colouring‚Äù but is meant to grow into a **general playground**: fractals, differential-equation flows, algebraic surfaces, knot animations, and more.

Goals (observable intent):

* **Self-contained** ‚Äì runs in any modern browser; no server component required.  
* **Composable** ‚Äì each animation is an isolated React component with its own GLSL shaders, props, and UI controls.  
* **Pedagogical** ‚Äì clear code, extensive comments, and references to underlying maths.  
* **Art-friendly** ‚Äì export stills, GIF loops, and high-resolution renders.

## 3‚ÄÇQuick start

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/<USER>/animath.git
cd animath
npm ci          # reproducible install

# Live-reload dev server
npm run dev     # ‚Üí http://localhost:5173
````

Production build & local preview:

```bash
npm run build   # outputs static files to dist/
npx serve dist  # quick sanity check
```

Node ‚â• 20, npm ‚â• 10 recommended.

## 5‚ÄÇCreating a new animation

PROJECTED EXAMPLE OF WORKFLOW, OPEN TO REVIISION.
1. `mkdir src/animations/myCoolThing`
2. Implement `<MyCoolThing/>` extending the `Canvas3D` wrapper.
3. Add route entry in `src/index.tsx`.
4. Provide a `README.md` inside the folder explaining the maths.

*Tip:* Keep GLSL strings inline for zero-fetch builds; use `vite-plugin-glsl` if you prefer external files.
