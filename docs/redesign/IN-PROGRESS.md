# In progress / known gaps

The live ledger of design areas that are **intentionally unfinished** in the prototype, plus open
questions. The implementing agent should update this file as phases land.

## Implementation status (repo, branch claude/new-chrome)

- ✅ **PARAM-MAP gate** — `docs/redesign/PARAM-MAP.md` (all 10 apps; Polygon Worlds, merged from
  main mid-overhaul, mapped during its migration).
- ✅ **Phase 0/1 — tokens & skins**: `src/chrome/theme.css` (5 `[data-theme]` blocks + am-*
  component styles), fonts via `<link>`, `useSkin`/`SkinPicker`, persisted `chrome:skin`,
  ControlPanel restyled to tokens (`--cp-*` aliased), `scripts/shoot.mjs` takes `SKIN` env.
- ✅ **Phase 2 — gallery + routing**: Gallery at `#/` (hero, chips, 10 preview cards from
  `chrome/catalog.ts`), TopBar (brand-mark Home, mode pills, "?" explainer modal, SkinPicker),
  old Menu deleted; `MIGRATED` route set governs the two-chrome interregnum.
- ✅ **Phase 3 — workspace engine + pilot**: `src/chrome/workspace/` (geometry math ported
  verbatim; pointer-capture drag; soft-magnetic snap + guides; tight dock; never-overlap
  freeSlot; collapse-chain reflow; raise-on-touch; view windows hide-don't-unmount; per-app
  layout persistence `ws:<appId>`; built-in + saved layouts; PhoneWorkspace dock/sheet).
  Complex Particles pilots it (Essentials/Appearance/Rotate layouts).
- ✅ **Phase 4 — all 11 apps migrated** (Complex Particles, Fractals, Mandelbrot ↔ Julia,
  Plane Transform, Topology Walk, Trinary Observatory + Lab, Stable Marriage,
  Stable Matching, Agentic Sorting, Polygon Worlds; legacy `#/fractals-cpu` kept
  unlisted with a minimal Home affordance). Old chrome deleted: AppShell,
  ActionFloater, useFloaterDrag, Menu, PlaybackFloater, PlaneCurveFloater,
  QuarterTurnBar. PARAM-MAP fully checked off; the only new view surface found
  during migration (Stable Matching's lattice) got its own view window + layout.
- ✅ **Phase 5 — phone mode** verified at 390×844 (gallery single-column; stacked
  view cards + bottom dock + sheets on the apps).
- ✅ **Phase 6 — polish baseline**: focus-visible rings, prefers-reduced-motion,
  Escape-to-close on menus/modals/sheets, aria-labels on all icon-only chrome
  buttons, hit targets (40px rail / 44px dock), screenshot sweep across skins in
  `shots/`. Docs updated (CLAUDE.md, README.md, BUILDING_AN_APP.md).

## Decisions added during implementation

- **Explainer surface**: top-bar "?" → modal (ExplainerModal wrapping the existing Readme
  renderer). The modal carries `EXPLAINER.md` + the old About `README.md` joined with a rule, so
  the drawer's About section content survives.
- **Gallery previews**: cheap 2D-canvas sketches, not the real renderers —
  ~10 simultaneous WebGL contexts on the landing page is fragile; revisit later (user decision).
  Now **one flavor per app** (was 3 shared flavors): warping plane grid, palette-cycling
  Mandelbrot, Mandelbrot↔Julia split with a moving c, twisting corridor, Gale–Shapley proposal
  round, concurrent sorting agents, preference-matrix lattice walk, glued-square torus walk.
- **Catalog**: 10 cards — the 8 designed apps + Stable Matching + Polygon Worlds (new app merged
  from main). Legacy `#/fractals-cpu` stays an unlisted route (user decision).
- **Trinary tabs → TopBar mode pills** (Observatory | Lab), hash routes and Lab URL-query config
  preserved; each mode is its own Workspace (`trinary-obs` / `trinary-lab`).
- **StableMatching visualizer/lab tabs → built-in layouts** toggling two view windows.
- **Saved layouts capture view geometry** too (spec over prototype, DESIGN-SPEC §2).
- **View windows collapse by hiding, not unmounting** (WebGL state survives); `Canvas3D` ignores
  zero-size resizes.
- **Pointer events** (capture-based) for window drag/resize — desktop touch works, closing one
  IN-PROGRESS gap below.

## Resolved prototype-era sections (kept for the record)

- ~~Designed but mocked~~ — every panel control is bound to real app state
  (the PARAM-MAP gate, Phase 4); analyze-tier readouts show real run data;
  gallery previews are authored per-app sketches (see decision above).
- ~~Designed for 3 apps in depth, 5 by analogy~~ — every app's panels were
  validated against the actual code during its migration.
- ~~Explainer placement~~ — the top-bar "?" modal (see decision above).
- ~~Touch on desktop-sized touch devices~~ — windows use pointer-capture
  events (mouse, touch, pen).
- ~~Dock/rail overflow invisible~~ — both bars show fade + chevron scroll
  hints at whichever edge has more content.

## Still open after implementation (carried forward)

- **Keyboard window management** (move/dock/cycle windows without a pointer) —
  panels/rail/menus are keyboard-operable; window placement is not.
- **Linked-view extras** for Mandelbrot↔Julia (viewport zoom-lock toggle);
  seed propagation works as before.
- **Skin-aware canvas palettes**: engines keep their own colors; only the
  chrome + `--viz-bg` follow the skin (gallery previews branch light/dark).
- **Saved-layout management**: naming still via `window.prompt`; no rename/
  reorder/export.
- **Gallery search** (no UI yet).
- **Phone**: no landscape spec; one sheet at a time; no drag-reorder of view
  cards.
- **Embeds phase 2** (docs/EMBEDS.md): the `s=` catch-all param and the
  "Embed this view" share dialog.
- **Chrome review 2026-06-10** (`docs/redesign/CHROME-REVIEW.md`): always-on
  **action strip** for primary verbs (phone opens every app inert today);
  **fullscreen control access** (incl. the rail-opens-hidden-panel z-index
  bug); a **split-view primitive** so Plane Transform's two panes become one
  window; per-view start hints; legitimize the MovePad HUDs as `ViewDef.hud`.

## Deliberate removals (do not resurrect without discussion)
- The old **draggable floater** → replaced by openable `drive` panels you can place beside the plot.
  - *2026-06 ruling (three-hats, CHROME-REVIEW P1):* the **action strip** is NOT the floater
    resurrected — it is fixed-position, chrome-owned, non-draggable, buttons-only, and a
    structural projection of an existing drive/playback panel (constraints enforced in
    `ActionDef` + `validateActions`). Keep it that way.
- The old **in-app cross-app switcher** → gallery is the only hub.
- **Settings / Actions / Function / About** menu taxonomy → replaced by the 11-archetype vocabulary.

## Decision log (running)
- 2026-06: Workspace model chosen over fixed inspector (A) and bottom dock (C) after exploration;
  phone mode inherits C's bottom-sheet pattern.
- 2026-06: Vocabulary frozen at 11 archetypes / 5 tiers.
- 2026-06: Skins frozen at 5; Phosphor doubles as the "all-mono" stress test of the type system.
- 2026-06: View windows gain a **fullscreen** toggle (desktop + phone) implemented as a CSS-only
  restyle of the same DOM node (fixed inset-0) so WebGL contexts survive; fullscreen is transient
  (not persisted). Phone view cards gain a bottom **resize grip**; per-view heights persist under
  `animath:v1:wsphone:<appId>` (parallel to the desktop `ws:<appId>` rects).
- 2026-06: Particle camera became a **free-orbit quaternion** (trackball, no pole stops); the
  Camera panel gains a Drag: Orbit | Pan pill.
- 2026-06: **Stereo retired** (it was the same stereographic map as Torus); the projection pills
  became **one slider with sticky labeled stops** — Perspective ⇠ Torus ⇢ Sphere (= Hopf
  internally) — fractional positions are live GPU morphs, the axis cross fades toward the torus,
  and the drop axis and slider release each other (most recent intent wins). Hopf fiber overlay
  and "Hopf study view" removed.
- 2026-06: **Embeddable applets** (docs/EMBEDS.md): chrome-less `#/embed/...` routes for the
  particle and plane viewers, URL-configured with ephemeral state; reference host page at
  `/embed-demo.html`.
- 2026-06: **CHROME-REVIEW PR A landed** (three-hats-reviewed; docs/redesign/CHROME-REVIEW.md):
  window z compacted to 1..n in `sanitize()`/`raiseWindow()` (unbounded persisted z could cross
  the fullscreen layer); z-layer scale named once (`workspace/layers.ts` ↔ `--z-*` tokens in
  theme.css); panels re-base above fullscreen views (`zBase`), so the rail works in fullscreen;
  **staged Esc** via one layer stack (`useEscLayer` — menus/sheets/modals/fullscreen peel one per
  keypress; panels stay ✕-only); the explainer opens from the fullscreen header (modal portaled
  to body). **vitest adopted** (`npm test`, first tests on layouts + escStack) and
  `scripts/probe-fullscreen.mjs` added as the headless interaction proof. User decisions
  recorded: Correspondence tap-to-pick will be ungated (PR D); embeds will carry the action
  strip (PR B).
- 2026-06: **CHROME-REVIEW PR B landed — the action strip** (DESIGN-SPEC §2 "The action strip"):
  `WorkspaceProps.actions` + `ActionDef` (buttons-only, ≤5, static labels, one primary,
  `sectionId` projection of a Drive-tier panel, dev-validated by `validateActions`), rendered
  by the chrome bottom-center on desktop / above the dock on phone, persistent through
  fullscreen (`--z-actionbar`; explainer modal moved to `--z-modal` 150). Wired into the four
  simulation apps: Stable Matching (contextual GS-run ↔ RVV-replay sets), Stable Marriage,
  Agentic Sorting, Trinary Observatory. Three transport glyphs (pause/step/finish) added as
  chrome *utility* icons — not archetypes. Embeds scoping (decision c): the `buttons=` row is
  the strip's embed form. Probe: `scripts/probe-actionbar.mjs` (11 checks).
- 2026-06: **CHROME-REVIEW PR C landed — split views** (DESIGN-SPEC §2): `ViewDef` became a
  discriminated `node | panes` union; `SplitPanes` renders a fixed equal flex split (no
  divider, by ruling — equal inscribed squares keep domain/image scale-commensurable), shared
  by ViewWindow, phone cards, and the Plane Transform embed (orphaned `.am-embed-pane` CSS
  removed). Plane Transform migrated to ONE window `z ↦ f(z)` (fresh id `plane`, panes
  `z — domain` / `w = f(z) — image`); stale two-window persisted rects sanitize away.
  Mandelbrot ↔ Julia deliberately stays two windows (linkage by parameter, not scale).
  Probe: `scripts/probe-split.mjs` (6 checks: equal panes through resize + fullscreen, embed
  parity).
- 2026-06: **CHROME-REVIEW PR D landed — start hints + ungated pick**: `ViewDef.hint` renders
  a centered, math-anchored invitation on the shared `.am-view-overlay` layer (pass-through;
  P3's HUDs will live there later), gone on the view's first pointer interaction, per-session
  only. Hints on Correspondence ("tap to choose c — the Julia set follows"), Fractals,
  Plane Transform, and the particle viewers (via ParticleViewerShell). **Correspondence
  tap-to-pick ungated** (user decision a): the Seed panel's arm button removed — tap is
  already gesture-disambiguated, so tapping the Mandelbrot just picks c (EXPLAINER updated).
  Probe: `scripts/probe-hints.mjs`. Follow-up idea (pedagogy): Plane Transform's hint could
  *arm* draw mode rather than name the Curves panel — deferred with P3.
