# Resume Solid Worlds (space worlds) — Lived seams decor prototype

## Session purpose

Make Solid Worlds feel **"lived in."** Per Dan's "topological interior decorator"
prompt: add a second visual mode to the existing `#/solid-worlds` app — a
**Decor: Diagnostic / Lived seams** flip switch in the View panel — where the
room looks inhabited by someone who understands the topology. The lived objects
must **use the face identifications** (pipes/shelves/ladders/floors that only
make sense because of the gluing), not just be furniture. Deep treatment for two
target worlds (**3-torus**, **Klein × Circle / amphicosm**); a sparse generic
fallback elsewhere. Visual/design layer only — no topology-engine changes.

## Previous session

First tracked session on **this** branch (`claude/animath-space-worlds-hm7wui`).
For continuity I read the two most recent Solid Worlds handoffs, both from this
week:

- [`3d-manifold-worlds-imwmal/2026-06-20-S01`](../../handoff/3d-manifold-worlds-imwmal/2026-06-20-S01-solid-worlds-continue.md)
  — **completed.** Fixed the cell-engine "screw bug" (two independent bugs: a
  gluing "bounce" giving χ=1, and a too-coarse vertex link); all **8 catalog
  platycosms now dual-verified** (Γᵃᵇ ↔ cube cell complex agree on H₁, χ=0,
  vertex-link S²). Confirmed **−a2 (second amphidicosm) = ℤ⊕ℤ/4** against the
  literature. Build + 53 vitest + lint green. Only open item: a product/naming
  call.
- [`solid-worlds-review-bju3pc/2026-06-19-S01`](../../handoff/solid-worlds-review-bju3pc/2026-06-19-S01-solid-worlds-continue.md)
  — grew the catalog 4→8 platycosms via an independent Γᵃᵇ homology + free-action
  test; FRONT/BACK sign slab; verified-gate fix.

This branch already contains all of that engine work (`SCREW_BUG.md` is present),
so it is the continuation, not a parallel re-do.

## Working notes

<!-- Newest entry first. -->

### 🟢 code · 03:10 — Cutaway slider + arch moldings
**Why:** Dan: put the cut plane on a slider (position = fraction of the
camera→avatar distance), and add moldings to the arches.

- **Cutaway slider** (View panel, third-person only): `cutFrac` opt + `setCutFrac`
  on the engine; the clip plane now sits at `len * cutFrac` (clamped <0.95 so it
  never reaches the walker), replacing the old fixed `U*0.2`. Persisted, default 0.3.
- **Arch moldings:** an extruded casing band (jambs + arched header, `ExtrudeGeometry`)
  hugs each wall arch, proud of the wall toward the interior; a low torus rim frames
  the floor trapdoor. The openings now read as built architecture, not clean cuts.

Build green.

### 🟢 code · 02:55 — Walls solid-but-faintly-translucent (Dan's pick)
**Why:** Asked how solid the walls should be; Dan chose solid-but-faintly-
translucent (stage the surprise, but keep a hint of the copies).

Wall material → `transparent`, opacity 0.84, **depthWrite ON** (nearest wall
occludes the rest, so the tiled panels don't flicker like the old fully-transparent
panes). Result: walls read solid, the next room is hidden until the arch, but a
hint of the surrounding copies glows through — you can even see a WELCOME below
through the floor. Build green.

### 🟢 code · 02:40 — Off-center archways + solid walls (connections at doorways)
**Why:** Dan: connections between rooms should happen at archways (holes in
ceiling/floor where a world tips vertical↔horizontal), off-center; and the wall
arrows aren't helpful.

Replaced the faint open frames with **solid walls** (faint axis tint), each −axis
face a `ShapeGeometry` panel with one **off-center archway** (floor/ceiling: an
off-center hole). Key simplification: build only the three −axis faces — the cover
instancing draws each cell's +axis wall as its neighbor's −axis panel *transported
by the gluing*, so a far wall's opening is automatically the near opening after
the deck transform (no g-math in the decor). Off-center is what makes the turn/
mirror visible (a gluing fixes the face center). Verified the payoff headless:
quarter-turn throws the **chandelier onto a side wall** (up→sideways), the
amphicosm mirror-flips the neighbor, and you peer through the arch into the next
room. Removed the wall arrows. Furniture repositioned to clear the openings.
Build + lint(0) + 53 tests green.

### 🟢 code · 02:00 — Furnished the Rooms decor (looks like a room)
**Why:** Dan: the room doesn't look good — wants a rug, desk+lamp, fireplace,
picture, chandelier, and words on a surface; make it look like a room so the
gluing surprises you through the doorways.

Furnished the fundamental cube (`decor/rooms.ts`): rug (patterned, `rugTexture`),
desk + glowing lamp on the −x wall, fireplace with logs + ember glow on the −z
wall, a **WELCOME** sign over the mantel (`signTexture`, on the inward-facing −z
wall so it reads head-on), a framed sunset picture on the +x wall
(`pictureTexture`), and a candle chandelier from the ceiling. Lights are
emissive-only (no real point lights — they'd multiply across the cover and fight
the symmetrized lighting). Walls stay as the faint color-coded frames (the open
doorways). Built once and instanced, so each copy carries the cell's holonomy —
walk a doorway and the fireplace is on another wall / WELCOME reads backwards.
Verified headless (3-torus, amphicosm, quarter-turn); reads clearly as a room.
Build green.

### 🟢 code · 01:25 — Cutaway anchored at the camera + fog decoupled from depth
**Why:** Dan: move the cut plane closer to the camera; the fog is way too strong.

Cutaway: re-anchored the clip plane to a short gap **in front of the camera**
(`CUT_GAP = U*0.2`, clamped to the near half so it never reaches the character),
instead of measuring back from the character. It now clips just the near wall the
camera pokes through and leaves the character's surrounding room intact.

Fog: the strength regression was a side effect of dropping cover depth to 1 — the
fog near/far scaled with `(depth+0.55)*size`, so the small radius pulled the fog
right in. Floored the fog **reference distance** at the depth-3 scale
(`Math.max(depth,3)`), so a calm single room is crisp while the deep hall still
fades. Fixes it regardless of the persisted fog value (no localStorage reset
needed). Build + lint(0) green.

### 🟢 code · 01:05 — Third-person cutaway clip plane (avatar no longer buried)
**Why:** Dan: avatar gets buried behind walls in third person; wants the cutaway
we discussed — hide cells between camera and character.

Added one world **clip plane** just in front of the character, perpendicular to
the camera→character line (`renderer.localClippingEnabled = true`; the plane is
shared by reference with every cover material via `applyClipping()`, re-pointed
after each `buildCover`). Everything nearer the camera than that plane is
discarded, so intervening walls vanish. The **floor is exempt** (kept whole, so no
gap in the ground) and the **avatars are exempt** (separate from `coverRoot`, so
never clipped regardless of margin). Empty array in first person. Verified the
wiring with a negative-margin test (pushed the plane past the avatar → all walls
clipped, floor + avatar remained), then restored `CUT_MARGIN = U*0.45`. Build green.

### 🟢 code · 00:30 — "Too busy" → faint walls + calm default cover depth
**Why:** Dan: everything far too busy; make the walls very faint.

Three moves: (1) **faint walls** — thin muted frames (dim X/Y/Z hues) + a small
soft-slate arrow, replacing the bold frame + white arrow. (2) In Rooms mode the
shared **edge-frame + floor grid** drop to a near-background tone (they were the
bright lattice fighting the faces). (3) Root cause of the busyness was **cover
depth 3** — ~300+ tiled cells receding to infinity, so even faint marks pile into
a dense lattice. Tested depth 1/2/3: depth 1 is the calm sweet spot and still
reads in *both* modes (diagnostic keeps its FRONT-sign recession; rooms becomes a
quiet single room). Set `DEFAULT_COVER_DEPTH = 1` (slider still →10 for the deep
hall). Verified headless across 3-torus + amphicosm, both persons. Build green.

### 🔴 blocker → 🟢 fix · 23:45 — Transparent faces flickered ("view unstable"); switch to alpha-test cutout
**Why:** Dan: the view is completely unstable. Semi-transparent faces tiled across
the cover have no stable draw order (per-object transparent sort flips with camera
motion) + z-fight where copies nearly coincide → flicker.

Fix: drop alpha **blending**, use alpha **testing** (hard cutout). The faces now
draw **only** their colored border + chiral arrow (fully opaque); the rest is
genuinely open. With `alphaTest: 0.5` they render in the opaque pass, depth-tested
like all other geometry — rock stable, still see-through (the open area). Also
**dropped the grid** I'd added (clutter; Dan picked color + motif, not a grid),
leaving a bold colored frame + white arrow per face. Re-verified headless: calm,
oriented, no blending. Build + lint(0) + 53 tests green.

### 🟡 milestone · 23:25 — Pivot to painted faces (orientation-first); replaces architecture
**Why:** Dan: the interior architecture was too complicated / hard to orient.
Chose (via AskUserQuestion) see-through tinted faces + a directional motif.

Ripped out all the walls/doorways/stairs/floor furniture. `decor/rooms.ts` is now
~50 lines: it paints the cube's **six faces**, glued pairs sharing a color (X red ·
Y green · Z blue, the corner-marker convention), each a semi-transparent tinted
panel with a **chiral up-arrow** motif (`textures.ts:faceMotifTexture`). The room
is otherwise empty. Built once + instanced, so a face returns **rotated** in a
turn world / **mirrored** in a glide world automatically; transparency keeps the
hall-of-copies visible. Headless captures (3-torus 1st/3rd, quarter-turn, amphicosm)
confirm it's far calmer and instantly orientable. Build + lint(0) + 53 tests green.

### 🟡 milestone · 22:55 — Glass walls + floor + distinct hues shipped; verified
**Why:** Closed Dan's three complaints (obstruction · no floor · walls alike).

- **Glass** wall panels (transparent, `depthWrite: true` so the tiled cover shows
  through only the nearest pane instead of stacking into murk) on **opaque
  colored base plinths** — the plinth carries each wall's bold hue, the glass
  above is see-through. First-person now looks straight down a corridor of
  doorways receding through the cover.
- **Floor**: opaque slab tiled per cell, built as four boxes around a **hole cut
  for the staircase** (wired to the Floor checkbox).
- **Distinct walls**: amber / teal / violet glass × dark / white / black trim ×
  tall · wide-corbel-arch · double-portal doorways.

Verified headless (3-torus 3rd + 1st, amphicosm). Build + lint(0) + 53 tests
green. Note: a faint frosted haze remains where many far panes overlap — the
plinths + lower walls + depth-writing keep it readable; true fix would be
near-cell culling (Dan's other suggestion), a bigger engine change.

### 🟣 decision · 22:20 — Glass walls + real floor + distinct walls (Dan's 2nd round)
**Why:** Dan: solid walls obstruct the view; there's no real floor; the walls are
too indistinguishable.

- **Glass walls**: wall panels become transparent (frosted glass, depthWrite off
  so they never occlude) set in **opaque colored frames** (top rail + door
  surrounds) so the architecture stays crisp through the glass. This is the
  see-through fix (chose glass over near-cell clipping — robust with instancing).
- **Real floor**: an opaque floor slab tiled per cell, built as four boxes around
  a central **hole cut for the staircase** (the literal hole in the floor; stacks
  into a shaft in the vertical cover). Tagged `floor` so the Floor checkbox owns it.
- **Distinct walls**: three clearly different hues (amber / teal / violet glass) ×
  contrasting trim (dark / white / black) × distinct doorway shapes (tall · wide
  corbel arch · double portal).

### 🟡 milestone · 22:10 — Rooms decor built + verified; build/lint/test green
**Why:** Delivered the new direction (solid walls + doorways + spiral stair) and
confirmed it renders across worlds in headless WebGL.

Replaced `decor/livedSeams.ts` with `decor/rooms.ts` (and removed
`plaqueTexture` — no flat signs). The Rooms mode builds, world-agnostically:
three interior walls (terracotta tall doorway · slate corbel-arched doorway ·
sage double portal), each a thick box slab carrying real 3D openings, placed at
fractional offsets (x −0.45h / +0.5h, z +0.4h) so the rooms straddle the seams;
plus a one-turn spiral staircase (treads + newel + floor/ceiling collar) on the
vertical gluing. Same-color boxes are merged into one geometry each (≈6 draw
calls). Renamed `DecorMode` value `lived-seams` → `rooms` (label "Rooms").

Headless captures (3-torus, amphicosm, quarter-turn, first-amphidicosm, 3rd +
1st person) confirm: solid colored walls with doorways + the spiral stair render
correctly; diagnostic mode untouched. The stair's chirality flip / rotation is
**emergent** from the cover (no special-casing) — visible by traversing into a
neighbor cell, not in a single central frame. Walls have no collision (you walk
through). `npm run build` + lint(0) + 53 tests green.

### 🟣 decision · 21:50 — Pivot: rip out flat signs, build real walls + doorways + spiral stairs
**Why:** Dan: the lived-seams plaques/flat decor missed. New direction: solid 3D
architecture only (no flat signs), walls *inside* the domain so rooms cross
seams, spiral stairs through floor/ceiling holes (chirality differences are a
feature).

Plan:
- **Remove** the lived-seams module + `plaqueTexture` (no flat signs). Keep the
  Decor-mode plumbing; rename the second mode `'rooms'` (label "Rooms").
- **Walls with depth**: thick box slabs (not planes) carrying doorway openings
  (built as pillars + lintels, so the opening is a real 3D gap). Different
  shapes (tall / wide / double or corbelled) and colors.
- **Inside the domain**: place walls at interior fractional offsets (x≈−0.45h,
  +0.5h; z≈+0.4h), full-span on the cross axis, open-topped. Because they tile,
  the rooms they bound straddle the cube seams — a room is literally assembled
  from pieces of adjacent fundamental domains.
- **Spiral staircase** on the vertical (y) axis, full height, exactly 1 turn over
  the cube so it threads the y-gluing continuously. Built once → the cover
  reflects/rotates it per world, so the helix **chirality flips in mirrored cells
  and rotates in turn worlds** automatically. Plus floor/ceiling collar rims to
  read as the hole.
- **World-agnostic**: same architecture for every world; the deck transforms make
  each world look different. Merge boxes per color into one geometry to keep draw
  calls low. No engine-math/movement changes (walls are visual; you fly the shaft).

### 🟡 milestone · 21:33 — Lived seams implemented + visually verified; build green
**Why:** Feature complete for the two target worlds; confirmed in headless WebGL.

Added `DecorMode = 'diagnostic' | 'lived-seams'` (engineTypes), `setDecorMode`
on the engine, a `Decor` Pills switch in the View panel (persisted), and a new
`decor/livedSeams.ts` module + `plaqueTexture` label helper. `buildRoom` now
dispatches: shared frame/floor/grid, then diagnostic **or** lived decor, then the
shared label/corner resources. Defaults tuned for readability: cover depth 4→3,
fog 0.12→0.2.

Headless capture (seed `decorMode`, drive the World `<select>`) confirms both:
- **3-torus** — level wraparound pipe + split counter + floor rug + floor↔ceiling
  ladder, all full-span so they tile into continuous infrastructure (UP RETURNS
  BELOW, SAME SHELF, WRAPAROUND PIPE plaques). Reads as a periodic apartment.
- **amphicosm** — the headline: a pipe low-at-−x / high-at-+x tiles into a
  continuous **diagonal floor↔ceiling zigzag** (the y-reflection made visible),
  with a +x-wall service shaft and explicit LOCAL FLOOR / CEILING SIDE panels.
- **diagnostic** unchanged (regression shot: FRONT sign + landmark props intact).

First pass at plaque sizes was wildly too big (sized in `U`≈9 ≈ room size); fixed
to room-relative widths. `npm run build` + 53 vitest + lint(0 err) all green.

### 🟣 decision · 21:30 — Design for Lived seams: span-the-cube infrastructure
**Why:** Settle the approach before coding — what makes a prop "use the gluing"
rather than be furniture, and how to express it in the existing instancing model.

Read the four key files (`coverEngine.ts`, `engineTypes.ts`, `textures.ts`,
`SolidWorlds.tsx`) + `worlds.ts`/`solidSchema.ts`. The engine builds the
fundamental room once as reusable parts, then `buildCover()` instances each part
across the deck-translate cells. **Key lever:** a prop that spans the full cube
(±h) tiles seamlessly into its neighbor copy, so it reads as continuous
infrastructure — for free, no per-cell work.

- **3-torus** (straight translations): full-span axis-aligned props become
  continuous loops — a wraparound pipe along x, a split counter/shelf along x, a
  floor rug along z crossing the seam, a floor-to-ceiling ladder (up returns
  below). Nothing flips/rotates → periodic apartment.
- **Amphicosm / Klein × Circle**: x-pairing is `g(x,y,z)=(x+size,−y,z)` (reflects
  y). A pipe built **low at −x / high at +x** tiles into a continuous floor↔ceiling
  zigzag — the y-reflection made visible. Plus a service ladder at the +x wall,
  floor/ceiling panels (LOCAL FLOOR / CEILING SIDE), a catwalk, and short plaques.
- Plan: `DecorMode = 'diagnostic' | 'lived-seams'`; dispatch in `buildRoom`;
  `setDecorMode` on the engine; `Pills` in the View panel; persist like other
  controls. New `decor/livedSeams.ts` module + a `plaqueTexture` label helper.
  Readability: default cover depth 4→3, modest fog bump. No engine-math changes.

### 🟡 milestone · 21:17 — Session opened; oriented on Solid Worlds state
**Why:** Start-session bootstrap — read the latest handoffs, confirmed branch
lineage, and set up the progress report before any work.

Confirmed: branch `claude/animath-space-worlds-hm7wui` is freshly cloned and
already carries the full Solid Worlds engine (screw fix + 8 dual-verified
worlds). The engine side is complete per the two prior handoffs. Outstanding
threads are non-engine: (a) the app-naming product call ("Solid Worlds" vs
*Manifold Walk*), which Dan deferred last session; (b) optional visual/HUD
confirmation of the screw worlds reading "cross-checked"; (c) upgrading the −a2
citation to a primary source (was network-blocked). Awaiting Dan's direction on
which thread (or a new one) to pursue.
