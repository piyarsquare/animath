# Mobius Walk

A short on-rails stroll through a subtly twisted corridor. The hallway appears ordinary until you realise left and right have swapped. A gentle iridescent shader colours the walls while small objects line the passage.

Import `MobiusWalk` and mount it like any other `<Canvas3D>` scene.

## Textures

Earlier versions required downloading external PNG/JPG files for the corridor decorations.
These assets are now embedded directly as data URIs so the demo runs out of the box.
