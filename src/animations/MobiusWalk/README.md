# Mobius Walk

A short on-rails stroll through a subtly twisted corridor. The hallway appears ordinary until you realise left and right have swapped. A gentle iridescent shader colours the walls while small objects line the passage.

Import `MobiusWalk` and mount it like any other `<Canvas3D>` scene.

## Textures

The module expects two textures inside `public/textures/`:

```
public/textures/arrow.png
public/textures/painting.jpg
```

Both are small PNG/JPG assets hosted externally. Download them from:

- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piyarsquare/animath-assets/main/arrow.png>
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piyarsquare/animath-assets/main/painting.jpg>

Place the files in the folder above before running the demo.
