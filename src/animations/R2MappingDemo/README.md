# R2 Mapping Demo

A minimal example demonstrating the generic `R2Mapping` class. A grid of points
is coloured and animated using a selectable complex mapping. Use the small menu
to choose between several functions such as `sqrt`, `exp`, or `sin`.
The menu also lets you pick the particle layout (grid, circle, spiral, random, or ring).

Open `/#/r2mapping` on the deployed site to view this demo.
