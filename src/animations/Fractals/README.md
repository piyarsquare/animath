# Fractals 2D

Interactive Mandelbrot and Julia set viewer. The fractal fills the screen and a small
menu in the lower left provides palette, iteration and animation options. Pan and zoom
are performed using the buttons in the upper right â€“ no dragging or scrolling is needed.
When the Julia option is selected the complex parameter can be adjusted and the palette
can be animated.
