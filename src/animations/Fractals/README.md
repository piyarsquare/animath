# Fractals 2D

Interactive Mandelbrot and Julia set viewer. The fractal now resizes with the
window so pixels remain square in either orientation. A small menu in the lower
left provides palette, iteration and animation options. Pan and zoom are
performed using the buttons in the upper right â€“ no dragging or scrolling is
needed. When the Julia option is selected the complex parameter can be adjusted
and the palette can be animated. Zooming or panning recomputes the fractal each
time.
