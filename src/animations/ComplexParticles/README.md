# Complex Particles

Visualises a complex map `z -> f(z)` using domain colouring in four dimensions. The vertex shader computes colours while the fragment shader renders round glowing points. Rename from the earlier `ComplexSqrtParticles` to reflect that any analytic function can be displayed. A small menu lets you pick the function and a saturation slider tweaks the colour intensity in real time.
