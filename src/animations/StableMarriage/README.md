# Stable Marriage Lab

This module visualizes the stable marriage (Gale–Shapley) process with a mixed-proposer model. Each participant holds a ranked preference list that blends a shared “quality” signal (consensus) with private noise. The visualizer lets you step through proposals, introduce proposer bias, and inspect average ranking outcomes and stability checks.

The lab view scans consensus levels for both groups and displays heatmaps of average match quality and proposer advantages. It uses repeated headless simulations to quantify how consensus and bias shape outcomes.
