# Complex Roots

Visualises the family of maps $z \mapsto z^{p/q}$ using domain colouring in four dimensions. Integer spinner boxes allow you to set the numerator $p$ and denominator $q$ of the exponent. All other controls mirror the **Complex Particles** demo: particle count, size, opacity, colour intensity, shimmer, jitter, hue shift and camera distance. Toggle **object mode** to switch between glowing sprites on black and solid points on white.
